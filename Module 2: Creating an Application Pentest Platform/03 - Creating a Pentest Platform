- Creating pentest setup on Jailbroken iPhone

Cydia
 - App store for jailbroken iPhones.
 
iOS
 - Very stripped down version of a Linux-Based system
 - Utilities requried to audit apps do not exist by default
 - Cydia allows us to download these audit tools onto the jailbroken iPhone.
 
Tools to Install from Cydia
 - OpenSSH: to ssh in as root
 - Sections -> Packaging -> APT 0.6 Transitional (apt-get)
 
What to do After Downloading apt-get
 - # apt-get install [tool]
 - Should get: Erica Utilities, Wget, unzip, adv-cmds, cycript...
 - Only get the bare minimum of tools you need. 
 
Connectivity
 - ssh into the ip of the iOS device
 or
 - USB multiplexing using a tool called usbmuxd
   - forwarding using the tcprelay script from local port 22 to remote port 22
   - can logon to phone over USB
   - Means you don't have to have an external network to pentest!
