Property List Files
 - Most common way of storing user and application settings on iOS
 - Inside the files, the data is serialized and can be read by applications quickly
 - plutil inspects and converts plists if needed
 
List of Applications
 - # cd /
 - # find . -name com.apple.mobile.installation.plist
 - ^ all applications that are installed (whenever) are stored in that file ^
 - demo with Wordpress done to show that this is the case.
 
Plutil
 - # plutil -convert xmli com.apple.mobile.installation.plist
 - Converts the file to XML file ^^
 - Here we can find the exact container that Wordpress is being held
 - # cd /private/var/mobile/Applications/[container id]
 - now we are inside the wordpress application directory.
 - if you go inside Library we can see preferecnces.
 
- Plist files are very important, and plist allows us to convert into something we can use and understand as pentesters

Another Way to Find all Applications Housed on a Device
 - # cd /private/var/mobile/Applications
 - # ls *
 - plist option above is probably better/faster because there may be a lot of applications installed and this would show EVERYTHING.
