- Basics of Jailbreaking
- Last module we discussed why we need to jailbreak: the ios environment is super restrictive (in a good way)

Jailbreaking
 - Breaking through the jail to allow running of your own applications, access the system, gain ROOT.
 - Control with max privleges
 - Probably voids warranty
 
How does it work?
 - Similar to other exploitation.
 - How would you exploit chrome?
   - Browser autopwn module with available exploits
 - Idea is to use existing vulnerabilities or find a new one, exloit, gain priveleges, do stuff

Types of Jailbreaks
 - Untethered: Once you break, you can restart and still have it jailbroken with all capabilities
 - Tethered: Once you restart, you will probably need to connect to pc and use a tool to reboot.
