What is this Tool?
 - application allowing us to dump class info in an applciation
 - Since Objective-C is a dynamically-typed language, the class information is completely embedded in it.
 - Apple encourages devs to give names of the Classes/objects in a very descriptive way (reveals a good amount of things)
 - Available on Cydia but its an old version. Can find it on a site (not going to list it here)
 
What can this Tool Do?
 - dump class info about app
 - This will help with runtime analysis later on.
 - iOS applications are encrypted, but not the ones that come installed via apple, which is why we can dump so easily.
 - If we wanted to use this tool for any other app, we would have to decrypt the app first.
