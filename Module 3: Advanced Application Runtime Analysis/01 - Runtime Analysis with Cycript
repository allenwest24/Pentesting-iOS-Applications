Cycript
 - Tool allowing you to do runtime injection and modification of control flow in iOS applications
 - you can view and modify data inside an iOS applciation
 - cycript.org
 - hooks into the application and elts us interact with it in interesting ways.
 - # cycript -p HelloWorld
 - cy# [UIApplication sharedApplication]
 - ^ Calling and giving us areference to the instance.
 - we want to store this 
 - cy# var app = [UIApplication sharedApplication]
 - cy# app
 - A short cut would be just to call UIApp and it will reference it directly.
 - cy# UIApp.delegate
 - tells us where and its name.
 - Can have multiple windows but the one showing is called the KeyWindow
 
Installing HelloWorld

Life Cycle of an Application
 - When a program starts, the main function is called.
 - UIApplication is the main entry point to create the application object.
 - has parameters
 - principleClassName is the name of class or subclass, if nil, UIApplication class is assumed.
 
Delegation
 - Let's say you have a window object that a user clicks closed.
 - Window object passes event to window delegate
 - Delegate class reacts to the event.
 - You have to say what the delegate class is for the object.
