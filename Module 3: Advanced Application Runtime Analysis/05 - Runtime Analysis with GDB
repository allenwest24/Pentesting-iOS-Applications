GNU Debugger
 - Cydia Debugger not working
 - use pod2g
 
Challenge 4 Application Demo
 - validating secret pin
 - use the class dumper
 - # gdb -p [process id]
 - (gdb) break -[<Name-of-class> <name-of-fucntion>:]
 - (gdb) c (continuing)
 - (gdb) disassemble
 - ^^ we see a blx (msgSend)
 - (gdb) break *[instruction identifier we are interested in]
 - (gdb) c
 - (gdb) info registers
 - (gdb) x/a $r0
 - Print the above register
 - (gdb) po $r0
 - Prints the object, in this case it's the input we gave.
 - do the same with $r1 = "isEqualToString"
 - MEANING, $r2 is the secret key we should be entering!
 
More Interesting Stuff
 - (gdb) set $r0 = 1
 - Set the value of a register at a breakpoint to 1 (true)!
