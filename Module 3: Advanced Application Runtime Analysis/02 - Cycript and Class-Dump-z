iOS Challenge 1 Application
 - Upon entering the correct password we will recieve a prompt telling us so.
 
Process
 - # ps aux | grep
 - tells us the processes running ^^
 - cycript -p [process id]
 - cy# UIApp
 - shows us the reference ^
 - cy# UIApp.keyWindow
 - ^ reference to current active window
 - cy# UIApp.keyWindow.rootViewController
 - controlling the screen at this point ^
 - cy# UIApp.delegate
 - reference to the delegate that tells how to handle events. ^
 - In another terminal, maneuver into the application directory
 - # class-dump-z iosChallenge-1 > class_dump
 - ^^ dump the class info from the app
 - vim into the dump and find the demoAppDelegate, as we found that to be the UIApp.delegate.
 - we can do the same to find the interface. 
 - we find a feld called enterPassword which is a input box.
 - cy# UIApp.keyWindow.rootViewController.enterPassword
 - Dumps what was last entered as well as other fields.
 - You can change fields.
 - cy# UIApp.keyWindow.rootViewController.systemResponse.text = 'Application Cracked'
