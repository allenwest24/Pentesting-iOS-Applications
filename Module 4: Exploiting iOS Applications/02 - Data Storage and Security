Plist
 - Simple way to store data on iOS and OS X
 - Some aps store confidential data here. Should not
 - WordPress stored in plist files for a while.
 
Challenge Application 2
 - Look at code, what went wrong, go back and see what happened
 - Username, Password, Store Securely button.
 - Stores the credentials inside a plist
 - This is a problem because plist doesn't encrypt or protect
 
- Unbelievable how many applications do this.
- Developers make this mistake because a typical user cannot reach it so they feel that the app data is safe.
- Not true.
- Can be found a lot in /Library/Preferences
