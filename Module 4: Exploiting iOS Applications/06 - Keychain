What is it?
 - Secure locations for certs, creds, anything of value
 - Everything is encrypted and tied to lock vs unlock status of device (should you choose this)
 - Enforced by the 6 accessibility parameters
 
Accessibility Parameters
 - kSecAttrAccessibleAfterFirstUnlock: Key chain data can only be accessed after first unlock.
 - kSecAttrAccessibleAfterFirstUnlockThisDeviceOnly: Same thing but not migrated with backups to other devices
 - kSecAttrAccessibleAlways: Can always be accessed regardless of lock status
 - kSecAttrAccessibleAlwaysThisDeviceOnly
 - kAccessibleWhenUnlocked
 - kAccessibleWhenUnlockedThisDeviceOnly
 
What's the Problem
 - Actually pretty secure
 - But, you are assuming they can't gain access to the device.
 - There are still attacks on device entries as well.
 
Keychain_Dumper
 - tons of them available
