What is it?
 - Schema-driven object graph management and persistent framework.
 - Core data is how we store info in iOS without worrying about management of data
 - can query and mine
 - Simple to leverage for alternative incentives
 
Core Data Sqlite vs others
 - If you inspect, you can see that the Table names start with the letter "Z" in core Data files.
 
Why Devs use this
 - They think Apple takes care of all security
 - Not so.
 
- Use same sort of exploit techniques as for sqlite
- Very easy to find out core data that is stored, even possibly confidential data.
