Possibilities
 - Developer (accidentally or on purpose) overrides cert checks by using self-signed or a dev server but forgets to change
 - Securely programmed
 - in both cases we need to be able to intercept SSL and change if we want.
 - Install Burp proxy!
 
BurpSuite
 - Proxy -> Options -> Edit Proxy Listeners -> Change to all interfaces (for starters)
 - Go to firefox -> preferences -> network settings -> enable proxy settings on port 8080.
 - visit an https url and you should see an error because you are being listened in on.
 - Certificate -> Portswigger -> Export
 - Ensure all traffic goes through burpsuite
 - iPhone options -> Wifi -> Settings for network -> Bottom is https proxy -> Manual -> Server mention burp ip and port 8080.
