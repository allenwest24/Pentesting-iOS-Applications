Backend Web Service Attacks
 - Data intercepted is usually going to backend servcies that come back with a response.
 - Because there is no visible way to find urls, devs dont test for the app security of them.
 - Web Service Auditing needs to be done
 
Authentication, Authorization, Session Management
 - Same as backend web service
 - All web application attacks are still valid
 - Cookies stored in Cookies.binarycookies
 - Are they wiped ever?
 - Binary cookie reader
 
XML Parsing Bugs
 - Most communication happens using XML
 - Injection based attacks
 - MITM is possible through manipulation of XML and going through the network
 
Improper Encryption
 - Custom encryption code (you serious?)
 - Storing encryption keys improperly
   - plist
   - sqlite
   - core data
   
Directory Traversal Attacks
 - Similar to web
 
Insecurity Due to Underlying C
 - Buffer overflows and memory corruption
 - format string vulnerabilities
 - poison NULL byte attacks
 - => OS Code and libraries usage
 
UDID Privacy COncerns
 - UDID - 40 character unique id per device
 - Track devices across applications
 - privacy concerns
 - many apps send it to the server side
 
UIWebViews
 - Used to embed web contetn in the app
 - can interpret HTML and execute Javascript
 - tampered with via user supplied input
 
Application Fuzzing
 - Locally
   - plist files and sqlite files
   - arbitrary data and run app to see what happens
   - Cycript
 - Remote
